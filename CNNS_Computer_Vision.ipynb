By changing the underlying pixels based on the formula within that matrix, you can perform operations like edge detection. For example, typically a 3x3 is defined for edge detection where the middle cell is 8, and all of its neighbors are -1. In this case, for each pixel, you would multiply its value by 8, then subtract the value of each neighbor. Do this for every pixel, and you'll end up with a new image that has its edges enhanced.\n",

The print (test_labels[:100]) shows the first 100 labels in the test set, and you can see that the ones at index 0, index 23 and index 28 are all the same value (9). They're all shoes. Take a look at the result of running the convolution on each and you'll begin to see common features between them emerge. Now, when the DNN is training on that data, it's working with a lot less information, and it's perhaps finding a commonality between shoes based on that convolution and pooling combination."
